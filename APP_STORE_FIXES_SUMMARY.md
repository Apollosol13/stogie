# App Store Review Fixes - Summary

## Overview
Fixed 3 critical issues identified during Apple App Store review to ensure compliance with App Store guidelines.

---

## ✅ Bug #1: Account Deletion (Guideline 5.1.1(v))

### Issue
App supported account creation but did not include an option to initiate account deletion.

### Solution Implemented

#### Backend Changes
- **File**: `backend/routes/profiles.js`
- Added `DELETE /api/profiles/me` endpoint
- Deletes all user data in proper order:
  1. Comments
  2. Likes
  3. Posts
  4. Reviews
  5. Humidor entries
  6. Follows relationships
  7. Profile data
  8. Auth user account

#### Frontend Changes
- **File**: `apps/mobile/src/components/profile/SettingsSection.jsx`
  - Added "Delete Account" option with trash icon
  - Shows clear warning: "Permanently delete your account and data"

- **File**: `apps/mobile/src/app/(tabs)/profile.jsx`
  - Implemented `handleDeleteAccount` function
  - Shows confirmation alert with detailed explanation
  - Makes API call to delete endpoint
  - Signs user out after successful deletion

### Compliance
✅ Users can now delete their accounts directly in the app
✅ Confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletion
✅ All user data is permanently removed
✅ Clear messaging about what will be deleted

---

## ✅ Bug #2: Location Permission Flow (Guideline 5.1.1 - Legal - Privacy)

### Issue
Location permission modal had a "Skip for Now" button allowing users to bypass the permission request.

### Solution Implemented

#### Frontend Changes
- **File**: `apps/mobile/src/components/map/LocationPermissionModal.jsx`
  - Removed "Skip for Now" button
  - Removed `onDecline` prop
  - Changed button text to "Continue"
  - Updated disclaimer: "You'll be able to allow or deny location access in the next step"
  - Made modal non-dismissible (can't close with Android back button)

- **File**: `apps/mobile/src/app/(tabs)/map.jsx`
  - Removed `onDecline` handler

### Compliance
✅ Users must click "Continue" to proceed
✅ Actual permission choice happens in system dialog (not a custom button)
✅ No way to skip or dismiss the explanation modal without proceeding
✅ Respects user's decision in the system permission dialog

---

## ✅ Bug #3: User-Generated Content Moderation (Guideline 1.2)

### Issue
App includes user-generated content but did not have all required precautions for content moderation.

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Backend - Database Schema
- **File**: `backend/migrations/add_moderation_features.sql`
- Created `content_reports` table:
  - Tracks reports for posts and comments
  - Stores reporter_id, content type, content ID, reason, status
  - Includes admin notes and timestamps
  - Row-level security policies for user access

- Created `blocked_users` table:
  - Tracks user blocking relationships
  - Prevents blocked users from interacting
  - Includes proper indexes for performance

#### 2. Backend - API Endpoints
- **File**: `backend/routes/posts.js`
  - `POST /api/posts/:id/report` - Report a post
  - `POST /api/posts/:postId/comments/:commentId/report` - Report a comment
  - Logs all reports for admin monitoring
  - Confirms 24-hour review timeframe to users

- **File**: `backend/routes/profiles.js`
  - `POST /api/profiles/:userId/block` - Block/unblock a user
  - `GET /api/profiles/:userId/is-blocked` - Check block status
  - Automatically removes follow relationships when blocking

#### 3. Frontend - Report Modal
- **File**: `apps/mobile/src/components/feed/ReportModal.jsx`
- Beautiful modal with predefined report reasons:
  - Spam or misleading
  - Harassment or hate speech
  - Violence or dangerous behavior
  - Inappropriate content
  - Intellectual property violation
  - Other (with custom text input)
- Confirms submission and 24-hour review promise

#### 4. Frontend - Report Posts
- **File**: `apps/mobile/src/app/(tabs)/home.jsx`
- Added flag icon to all posts (for non-owners)
- Opens ReportModal when tapped
- Users can report any post they don't own

#### 5. Frontend - Report Comments
- **File**: `apps/mobile/src/components/feed/CommentsModal.jsx`
- Added "Report" link to all comments (for non-owners)
- Opens ReportModal with comment context
- Integrated with post ID for proper tracking

#### 6. Frontend - Block Users
- **File**: `apps/mobile/src/app/user/[id].jsx`
- Added shield icon button next to Follow button
- Shows confirmation dialog with clear explanation
- Unfollows automatically when blocking
- Visual feedback (button changes color when blocked)
- Disables Follow button when user is blocked

#### 7. Updated Community Guidelines
- **File**: `apps/mobile/src/components/profile/CommunityGuidelinesModal.jsx`
- Added prominent "Zero Tolerance Policy" callout at top:
  - Explicitly states no tolerance for objectionable content
  - Warns of immediate removal and account suspension/ban
  - Red accent border for visibility

- Enhanced "Moderation & Enforcement" section:
  - 24-hour review commitment
  - Immediate removal of objectionable content
  - User ejection policy
  - Permanent bans for serious/repeat violations

- Added "Report & Block Features" section:
  - Explains how to use flag icon on posts
  - Explains "Report" option on comments
  - Explains block button on user profiles
  - Provides email contact for urgent matters

### Compliance
✅ Terms/EULA clearly state zero tolerance policy
✅ In-app reporting mechanism for posts and comments
✅ In-app blocking mechanism for users
✅ Filtering objectionable content (via reports and blocks)
✅ 24-hour review commitment stated in guidelines
✅ Clear enforcement policy (removal + user ejection)
