# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: October 6th, 2025**

Stogie respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share information when you use our mobile application.

## 1. Information We Collect

### a. Personal Information

**Email Address:** We collect your email when you create an account. It's used for login, account recovery, and necessary updates about your account.

### b. Location Data

Stogie uses your location (with your permission) to:
- Show nearby cigar stores on Google Maps.
- Display where users are logging smoking sessions.
- Improve recommendations and mapping accuracy.

You can disable location access at any time in your device settings, though some features may not work correctly without it.

### c. User-Generated Content

When you post, comment, like, or log a cigar session, this information may be visible to other users.
- Posts and smoke logs may appear on the map.
- Your digital humidor entries are stored under your account.
- Do not share information you wouldn't want public.

### d. Cigar Identification

When you use the Identify feature powered by OpenAI, uploaded images are processed by OpenAI's system to recognize the cigar. We do not store these images beyond what's necessary to complete the request.

### e. Usage Data

We collect basic analytics (such as app interactions, feature use, and session length) to improve performance and user experience.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use collected data to:
- Provide, operate, and improve Stogie.
- Enable social features like posting, commenting, and liking.
- Display cigar stores and community smoke sessions on the map.
- Communicate updates and respond to support requests.
- Ensure platform integrity and prevent misuse.

## 3. How We Share Information

We may share information in limited ways:
- **With Service Providers:** Including Google (for Maps and location data) and OpenAI (for cigar identification).
- **With Other Users:** Posts, comments, likes, and smoking sessions you choose to share are visible to others.
- **For Legal Reasons:** If required by law, regulation, or court order.
- **Business Transfers:** In the event of a merger or acquisition, user data may be part of the transfer.

We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties.

## 4. Data Retention

We retain data for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide our services. You may delete your account at any time to remove your data.

- **Location:** You may disable location services at any time via device settings.
- **Emails:** You can unsubscribe from non-essential communications.

## 6. Security

We take reasonable steps to protect your data from unauthorized access or misuse. However, no online service is entirely secure, and you use Stogie at your own risk.

## 7. Children's Privacy

Stogie is intended for adults aged 21 and older (or the legal age for tobacco use in your jurisdiction, whichever is greater). We do not knowingly collect information from minors. If we discover that a person under the required age has provided personal data, we will delete it promptly.
