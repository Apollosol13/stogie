# Response to Apple App Review - Guideline 1.4.3

## Changes Made to Address Physical Harm Concerns

We have updated the app's landing page to remove any language that could be perceived as encouraging tobacco consumption. The app is strictly a documentation and information tool for existing adult cigar enthusiasts.

### Specific Changes:

**1. Main Title Changed:**
- ❌ Old: "Your Digital Cigar Companion"
- ✅ New: "Product Information & Collection Tracker"

**2. Subtitle Updated with Disclaimer:**
- ❌ Old: "Track your collection, discover new cigars, and connect with fellow enthusiasts."
- ✅ New: "Document your existing collection, access product information, and connect with the community. For adults 21+. Not intended to encourage tobacco use."

**3. Feature Descriptions Made Neutral:**
- ❌ Old: "AI-Powered Scanner - Instantly identify any cigar with your camera"
- ✅ New: "Product Identification - Identify and document products for informational purposes"

- ❌ Old: "Find Nearby Shops - Discover cigar lounges and retailers near you"
- ✅ New: "Retailer Locator - Locate authorized retailers and licensed establishments"

### App Purpose:

Stogie is an **informational and collection management tool** for adults who are already cigar enthusiasts. The app:

- Does NOT encourage tobacco consumption
- Does NOT sell tobacco products
- Does NOT promote tobacco use to non-users
- DOES include health warnings during signup
- DOES require users to acknowledge they are 21+ and understand health risks
- DOES provide product information for educational purposes only

### Health & Safety Measures Already Implemented:

1. **Mandatory Terms Acceptance** - Users must agree to Terms of Service before account creation
2. **Age Verification** - Users must confirm they are 21+ during signup
3. **Health Warning Modal** - One-time warning appears after first signup with health risks
4. **Health Acknowledgment** - Users must acknowledge health risks in signup form
5. **Community Guidelines** - Content moderation with reporting/blocking features

### Comparison to Approved Apps:

Similar apps on the App Store include:
- Vivino (wine collection tracking)
- Untappd (beer collection tracking)
- Cigar Scanner (existing cigar identification app)

Our app follows the same model: documentation and information for adults consuming legal products.

**We believe these changes fully address the concerns raised under Guideline 1.4.3. The app now clearly positions itself as an informational tool rather than promotional content.**
