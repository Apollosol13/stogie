You retain ownership of any content you post to Stogie, including photos, comments, logs, and reviews ("User Content"). However, by posting, you grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license to use, display, and distribute your content within the App for operational purposes (like showing your sessions on the map or your posts in the feed).

- Display community smoke sessions.

By enabling location services, you consent to this use. You can disable location access anytime in your device settings, though some features will be limited.

- When using the Identify button, images you upload are processed by OpenAI to detect the cigar type.
- You acknowledge that these images may be transmitted to third-party systems for processing.
- You retain ownership of your images, but you grant us permission to process them for this purpose.
- We do not guarantee accuracy of AI identifications.

## 7. Community Standards

Violations may result in suspension or permanent removal from the platform.
